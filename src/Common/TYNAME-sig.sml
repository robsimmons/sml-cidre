    (* Type names are based on names which may be `matched'. In
     * particular, if two type names, n1 and n2, are successfully
     * matched, eq(n1,n2) = true. This may affect the canonical
     * ordering of type names. *)

    (* Type names and type variables have associated to them a
     * rank. This rank is used during elaboration to enforce that no
     * type variable is unified with a type containing type names
     * created `after' the type variable was created. During
     * elaboration there is a notion of a `current rank'. Type
     * variables and type names are created with the current
     * rank. Further, when a type name is created (with current rank)
     * the current rank is increased. The rank of a type name is then
     * fixed during elaboration. The rank of a type is the maximum
     * rank of all type variables and type names occuring in the
     * type. When a type variable is unified with a type it is checked
     * if the rank of the type is smaller than the rank of the type
     * variable. If not, unification fails. It is allowed to decrease
     * the rank of a type variable during elaboration to make
     * unification succeed.  After elaboration of a top-level
     * declaration all type names are decreased in rank to rank zero
     * and the current rank is decreased to rank zero.
